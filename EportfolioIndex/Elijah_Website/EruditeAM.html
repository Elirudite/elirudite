     			To put it as blandly as possible; My name is Elijah Claude and <br>
			I was born on September 19, 1994 in Riverdale, Georgia. <br>
			I am currently a Year Up and Atlanta Metro State College student <br> 
			and my journey for knowledge has been quite the ordeal. <br> 
			One rife with tribulations, emotions, imagination, and all things awesome. <br>
			I consider myself erudite because throughout my entire life my love of learning <br>
			and thirst for knowledge has stayed constant. I would enjoy narrating it <br>
			but I would much rather here about your story...<br>
			<q> Storytelling is a very old human skill that gives us an evolutionary advantage. <br>
			If you can tell young people how you kill an emu, acted out in song or dance, or that <br>
			Uncle George was eaten by a croc over there, don't go there to swim, then those young <br>
			people don't have to find out by trial and error. </q> ~ Margaret Atwood <br> </p>
	<p>
			What's interesting is that octopi (along with squids and mollusks) are the most <br>
			intelligent invertebrates out there; however, leading theories suggest that they <br>
			have not and may never advance further because the parents die shortly after <br>
			giving birth to the young. Which means that there is no way to pass information <br>
			from one generation to the next. So octupi fall victim to the same traps and <br>						predators as their predecessors... but enough 'fun facts'. <br>
