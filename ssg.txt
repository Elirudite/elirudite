Now come on Charles... The whole point of 'Freedom of Speech' is exactly to hash out differences like this in a civilized manner

I understand that that is technically a 'private' group... still... censorship is never a good thing... particularly for solving problems between diverse peoples.

@charlesjo hate crimes against white people are also up, so i agree

[9:30]  
i have seen many white people beaten like literally beaten, and i honestly haven’t seen it that much against minorities, although i admit there has been harassment

[9:32]  
if you believe that minorities are being beaten because of trump then you should provide some evidence. i will take on the same burden

charlesjo	[9:32 PM]  
@kurt: all hates crimes must stop

[9:33]  
i haven’t seen 1 case of this happen against a minority for their choice in voting for hillary clinton, not even 1!

[9:33]  
there are about a dozen of these i’ve seen and they are all confirmed with videos, and these are people being savagely beaten


kurt	[9:33 PM]  
there are about a dozen of these i’ve seen and they are all confirmed with videos, and these are people being savagely beaten

[9:34]  
these are hate crimes against white people, and politically motivated crimes done by liberals

[9:34]  
it’s shameful

[9:35]  
also i have to protest: i don’t believe that trump is racist xenophobic or any of the other slurs that you mentioned earlier, i truly think a lot of people are drinking too much social media cool aid

[9:36]  
this is the same kind of histeria that got trump voted in the first place, in my opinion, a sort of liberal echo chamber that people straight up got tired of

charlesjo	[9:36 PM]  
@kurt did you see the protester at trump ralley being sucker punched as he was being escorted out? (edited)

kurt	[9:36 PM]  
yes i saw it, i condemn that

[9:36]  
you aren’t even brave enough to condemn white people getting beaten up

charlesjo	[9:37 PM]  
Why do you think that?

kurt	[9:37 PM]  
you’re basically perpetuating the kind of violence

charlesjo	[9:37 PM]  
I condemn all violence

kurt	[9:37 PM]  
you’re rhetoric is the same rhetoric that’s fueling violence

[9:38]  
same thing that’s scaring children it’s sad bro

[9:38]  
i think you should check yourself

charlesjo	[9:39 PM]  
Shut up. You're imaging your wishful thought that progressives are violent. Not true. Reasonable people want peace.

kurt	[9:39 PM]  
the people i see getting beaten are all white people beaten by “progressives"

[9:39]  
what i’m saying is a simple fact

[9:40]  
and it’s well documented

[9:40]  
one dude got punched for causing a ruckus at a trump rally by some old redneck, is that all you got?

[9:40]  
did you watch the video charles?

[9:40]  
that’s multiple people on a street beating a guy for voting trump

charlesjo	[9:40 PM]  
See @shaunking's twitter timeline. It's a collection of all the hate crimes that has increased due to Trump's campaign.

kurt	[9:41 PM]  
i was blocked from his twitter for no reason so i’d rather not

[9:41]  
the reality is it’s true both ways

[9:41]  
some people are saying “build a wall” so what? white people and other non white trump supporters are being *beaten* on the streets

charlesjo	[9:42 PM]  
I'll send more timelines so you can have facts instead of your conspiracy blogs.

kurt	[9:42 PM]  
the only conspiracy was a fantasy that hillary was going to win

[9:43]  
and she lost via democratic process, i have faith in the system for the most part, it’s what we all agreed to

[9:43]  
but now there are all these whiners who can’t move forward, you seem like one of them charles

[9:43]  
it’s time for people to come together

[9:43]  
perpetuating rhetoric like yours isn’t a great way to be a leader, straight up

[9:44]  
it’s very insulting to discriminate members here too

[9:44]  
for their political beliefs

charlesjo	[9:44 PM]  
Kurt, you reference hate sites and alt right. And you want to bring people together?

kurt	[9:44 PM]  
i don’t reference hate sites

[9:44]  
i reference references

charlesjo	[9:45 PM]  
Infowars is not a hate site?

kurt	[9:45 PM]  
no, it’s not

charlesjo	[9:45 PM]  
@kurt please leave.

kurt	[9:46 PM]  
is TMZ a hate site?

cc @charlesjo

[9:46]  
why should i leave charles? for defending SSG members right to not have our political views insulted?

charlesjo	[9:49 PM]  
anyone else who thinks infowars and breitbart are not hate fill conspiracy sites, please leave.

[9:50]  
there is a world of difference between political views vs hate groups

dandelionsinmypocket	[10:11 PM]  
@kurt "it’s very insulting to discriminate members here too"
  Just to be clear: blocking someone for promoting hate is not discrimination - it is *natural consequences* for bad behavior. (edited)

[10:17]  
@dandelionsinmypocket booting people for their political beliefs is what SSG is about?

[10:18]  
basically please leave if you don't agree with Charles, even if you have contributed 100s of hours building the community and inviting hundreds of people

[10:19]  
@dandelionsinmypocket what hate was promoted?

[10:19]  
saying you don't believe that breitbart and infowars is a hate site is hate itself?

[10:19]  
that doesn't make any sense

[10:20]  
this is a tech group one i've contributed to a ton, and to blanket start banning people for political beliefs is just out right discrimination

[10:20]  
you are narrowing out a group of people and telling them to leave without provocation

[10:20]  
*THIS IS THE VERY MEANING OF DISCRIMINATION*

[10:23]  
now there are people online claiming that "bad behavior" is why we would get booted

[10:23]  
which bad behavior?

eruditelijah	[10:24 PM]  
Woah... woah.. woah... @charlesjo ... did ... you really just have @kurt leave?

[10:25]  
Im mostly a lurker.... But I've been here almost since the beginning... this division is not at all good for the standing of this group nor the unification of people

joeydomingo	[10:26 PM]  
please remember @charlesjo UNPROVOKED told people with certain political views to leave SSG

[10:26]  
@eruditelijah that's right, i was booted by @charlesjo
