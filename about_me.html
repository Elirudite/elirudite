						To be, or not to be, that is the question. <br>
            Life is hard and 'tis cold so I tend to count my blessings.
            <br> <br>
            Fresh out after a two year stint in a broken school system gilded by the International Baccalaureate Program, <br>
            I was a newfound high school graduate with a changed paradigm, already defying the statisticians. <br>
            I was accepted to two of ten great schools, both offering half my tuition... <br>Yet I was unable to net the rest lest my family pay in economic perdition. <br>
            The score was thus 10 to 2, and I was ready to give in. <br>
            No work experience, no people to call who weren't in a similar if not worse position; <br>
            No more will to fight or faith in crawling from this rocky pit of a socio-station. 
            <br><br>
            Still, I persisted. 
            <br><br>
            I found solace and inspiration through the likes of Ender and Shylock, and C. Clarke and the Dovahkiin,<br>
            Subsequently I found the will to recoup, and began selling knives for a living. <br>
            ‘Twas by convincing the parents of my friends' friends to buy kitchen cutlery that I first learned the skills of networking, public speaking, marketing, and pitching. <br>
            Skills I knew I would need come time to sell my ambitiously disruptive innovations to the masses of worldly minions.
            <br><br>
            Lo n' behold, by chance of fate and perceptive Google engines,<br>
            I found the turning point of my life. A place that hence cultivated those nascent skills to fight against my strife. <br>
            YearUp has thusly evened the odds and gave a hand up to a place rife <br>
            With opportunity gained by gritty perseverance… <br>
            Coaxing confidence out of its frail, withered shell of depressive reticence. 
            <br><br>
            ‘Twas my advisors who directed my ambitions, <br>
            Instructors who readied me for any IT position, <br>
            Mentor who uncovered my business acumen <br>
            And manager who field tested and molded me for a security-minded, risk management profession. <br>
            Finally Friends who have shored up my sociable individualism.
            <br><br>
            The score is thus nil. 
            <br><br>
            I have realized that life is as hard and cold as someone with a heart of gold.<br>
            Heating it with a bit of passion yields enough materials to build a bastion...<br>
            To engineer a superconductive bridge across the Opportunity Divide. <br> 
            And so I have realized... <br>
            To be or not to be the best I can be was never the question... <br>
            Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer or not... <br>
            Twas a quest, <br>
            One of many on my epic of hard-earned progression, <br>
            A path, along my <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rtslog&src=typd" target="_blank">Road 2 Success</a>
